I'm using Jonathan Anderson's protocols for this part of the portfolio task.
He suggests to update information when reviewing documents, or to note incorrect information for future correct.
GitHub allows for changes and commits to a main branch, allowing for modification of existing files and data.
I see this as a fitting medium to address this possible issue. 
If any information in this document is incorrect in the future, it can be modified and merged to the main branch in order to overwrite the incorrect information.

Jonathan also recommends to send group emails with a confirmation requirement.
As a requirement of this task is to share with the group, I will be sending a group email and asking for confirmation of all members in the group that they'v seen it.
